# hexagon

This is a prototype of a hexagonal map written in TypeScript and Pixi. I want to explore possibility of creating 2D game with React UI on top.

To run this app clone the repository, install it with `npm install` and start with `npm start`. The browser will open on `http://localhost:3000`.
